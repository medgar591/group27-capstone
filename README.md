## 1 Introduction

This section provides an overview of the vision document: its contents and its purpose.

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the process of coming up with a proof-of-concept dashboard for displaying histograms of data collected from ventilators in the NICU in EPIC for nurses to determine if certain infants' (under 36 weeks of age) oxygen saturation is too high.

### 1.2 Solution Overview

This document outlines the implementation of this dashboard.

Currently, there are Phillips Monitors that record oxygen saturation data for each infant. The hospital does not use EPIC but is planning to transfer to the system in the near future, so the proof of concept would be able to integrate with this software. The implementation would take the data from the monitors and track it into an application, where it would display graphs and clearly show which infants have oxygen levels above (and below) the safe levels. This application must be accessible from a desktop computer.


### 1.3 References

The Using Health Information Data Strategies to Support Efforts of Sustainability sent to us by Dr. Jabrzemski, as well as Brandon Kuehne and Kimberly Ernst, who helped determine requirements for the project and determine what success looks like.

## 2 User Description

### 2.1 User/Market Demographics

The user demographics will be nurses and supervisors working in the hospital. Potentially this could be brought to market as software for hospitals to purchase, but that is out-of-scope for this assignment. We don't have any specific target demographics, as this product is being made in-house for this specific hospital, but we want to make sure that the needs are met for the hospital. Specifically making sure that our product could be theoretically implemented into EPIC and that it's well documented, so a future team can implement it successfully without confusion.

### 2.2 User Personas

Nurses must be able to see if any infants have too high of oxygen saturation easily to be able to fix the probelm. Supervisors must be able to view past data to determine what nurses are administering too much oxygen and help notify them to fix this issue. Both of these people work in a high stress environment where visibility is key to make sure that solutions are easy to understand and allow quick action. Nurses particularly need to make sure all of their patients are stable and doing well and can get distracted by call buttons in rooms. Their version of success is nothing requiring their urgent attention. For supervisors, it would be making sure that nurses perform their responsibilities and hearing patient complaints. For our product, these patients can't complain, so it is important we vocalize their needs

### 2.3 User Environment

For nurses, this application would sit on a desktop computer / Monitor and would be visible in the NICU, to have clear visibility. Several nurses should pass by, so it should be visible by a casual glance for a nurse to determine if an infant's oxygen saturation is too high (or low). This application will also in the future have to integrate with EPIC, so it should be considered while designing the project.

### 2.4 Key User Needs

Currently, nurses cannot easily determine if an infant's oxygen saturation is too high. For low saturation, they have a buzzer on their person that will tell them to increase. This is not done for high saturation, as it is only dangerous in the long-term. This is why it needs to be visible for nurses, as it is not severely urgent for nurses to be immediately notified but should be fixed when nurses have time or plan to go into the NICU.
 
### 2.5 Alternatives and Competition

Currently there is no known competition for this project, as the hospital would not have come to us for a solution otherwise for a capstone project. This is why they need a custom built solution for their needs, so they are able to address unique concerns for their patients.
